The game is ZORK, a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.
You are standing in an open field west of a white house with a boarded front door.
A white house with a boarded front door is a known location and appears to be a beautiful colonial house.
The house is painted white and was owned by extremely wealthy individuals.
There is a small mailbox in the open field west of the house.
The small mailbox is already open and contains a leaflet that describes ZORK as a game to explore amazing territory.
